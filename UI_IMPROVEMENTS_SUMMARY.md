# EduVisual UI/Styling Improvements - Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented 5 major UI/styling improvements to the EduVisual frontend application.

---

## 1. Dashboard Page - "My Lectures" Heading Alignment ✅
**File:** `frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.jsx`

**Issue:** The "My Lectures" heading was not left-aligned with the lecture cards below it.

**Fix Applied:**
- Added `pl-0` class to the heading container to ensure proper left alignment
- The heading now aligns perfectly with the left edge of the lecture card grid

---

## 2. Landing Page - Feature Cards Border/Definition ✅
**File:** `frontend/src/pages/Landing.jsx`

**Issue:** The three feature cards ("AI Enhancement," "Visual Generation," "Easy Export") blended into the white background.

**Fix Applied:**
- Added `border border-gray-200` to Card components for visible borders
- Added `shadow-md hover:shadow-lg transition-shadow` for depth and interactivity
- Cards now have clear visual definition and stand out from the background

---

## 3. About Page - "How It Works" Section Text Centering ✅
**File:** `frontend/src/pages/About.jsx`

**Issue:** Text content in the "How It Works" section was left-aligned.

**Fix Applied:**
- Added `text-center` class to each step's text container
- Wrapped the entire section in `max-w-2xl mx-auto` for centered layout
- All step titles and descriptions are now center-aligned

---

## 4. About Page - "Why Choose EduVisual" Card Text Positioning ✅
**File:** `frontend/src/pages/About.jsx`

**Issue:** Text in feature cards sat too low within each card.

**Fix Applied:**
- Added `pt-4` class to CardBody component in the features grid
- Reduced top padding to bring content higher up in the cards
- Icons, titles, and descriptions now have better vertical spacing

---

## 5. Settings Page - Dark Mode Functionality ✅
**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/src/context/ThemeContext.jsx` (NEW)
- `frontend/src/hooks/useTheme.js` (NEW)
- `frontend/src/App.jsx`
- `frontend/src/pages/Settings.jsx`
- `frontend/tailwind.config.js`
- `frontend/src/index.css`
- All component files (Button, Card, Header, Modal, Spinner)
- All page files (Landing, Upload, Processing, Dashboard, LectureViewer, About)

**Features Implemented:**

### Theme Context & Hook
- Created `ThemeContext.jsx` for global theme state management
- Created `useTheme.js` custom hook for easy theme access
- Supports three modes: "light", "dark", and "auto"

### Dark Mode Detection
- "Auto" mode detects system preference using `prefers-color-scheme` media query
- Automatically applies dark theme if system is set to dark mode
- Falls back to light theme if system preference is light

### Persistence
- Theme preference is saved to localStorage
- Theme persists across browser sessions
- Automatically loads saved preference on app startup

### UI Updates
- Updated all components with dark mode classes:
  - **Card Component:** Dark backgrounds, borders, and shadows
  - **Button Component:** Dark variants for all button types
  - **Header Component:** Dark navigation and mobile menu
  - **Modal Component:** Dark backgrounds and text
  - **Spinner Component:** Dark color variants
  
- Updated all pages with dark mode support:
  - **Landing Page:** Dark gradient backgrounds, text colors
  - **Upload Page:** Dark form inputs, info boxes
  - **Processing Page:** Dark progress bars, status messages
  - **Dashboard Page:** Dark card backgrounds, text
  - **LectureViewer Page:** Dark backgrounds and text
  - **Settings Page:** Dark form inputs, sections
  - **About Page:** Dark backgrounds, text, and step indicators

### Tailwind Configuration
- Enabled `darkMode: 'class'` in `tailwind.config.js`
- Uses class-based dark mode (adds `dark` class to html element)
- Allows manual theme switching without relying on system preference

### Global Styles
- Added smooth transitions for theme changes (0.3s ease)
- Updated body background and text colors for dark mode
- Maintained accessibility and contrast ratios

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Theme Switching:** Test switching between Light, Dark, and Auto modes in Settings
2. **Persistence:** Refresh the page and verify theme persists
3. **System Preference:** Test Auto mode with system dark mode enabled/disabled
4. **Responsive Design:** Verify dark mode works on mobile, tablet, and desktop
5. **Contrast:** Ensure text is readable in both light and dark modes
6. **Transitions:** Verify smooth theme transitions when switching modes
